<center><h1>Custom Data Recording and Reporting</h1></center>
<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The mechanism for including custom recording/reporting code into collectl is very similar to that for
exporting custom data.  One uses the switch <i>--import</i> followed by one or more file names, separated
by colons.  Following each file name are one or more file-specfic arguments which if specified are
comma separated as shown below:

<div class=terminal>
<pre>
collectl --import file1,d:file2
</pre></div>

In this example collectl will look for the files <i>file1.ph</i> and <i>file2.ph</i>, noting
that the first has the single argument 'd'.  Collectl will execute a perl <i>require</i> on each 
file (in the order they're specified) and subsequently call functions in them from various locations
within collectl.  Looking for strings in both <i>collectl</i> and <i>formatit.ph</i> that begin 
with <i>&{$imp</i> will identify the locations where collectl calls the functions named in the API
and may help during the development/testing process to better understand what collectl is doing.
<p>
As a reference, a simple module has been included in the same main directory as collectl itself,
which is named <i>hello.ph</i> as collectl's version of <i>Hello World</i>.  Since it can't read
anything from /proc it is hardcoded to generate 3 lines of data with increasing data values.  Beyond
that bit a hand-waving, everything else it does is fully functional.  You can mix its output with
any standard collectl data, record to raw or plot files, play back the data and even send its output
over a socket.
<p>
It should be noted that although collectl itself does not use <i>strict</i>, which is a long story,
it is recommended these routines do.  This will help ensure that they do not accidentally reuse a
variable of the same name that collectl does and accidentally step on it.

<p><b>A couple of words about performance</b>
<p>
One of the key design objectives for collectl is efficiency and it is indeed very lightweight, 
typically using less than 0.2% of the CPU when sampling once every 10 seconds.  Another way to 
look at this is it often uses less than 192 CPU seconds in the course of an entire day.
If you care about overhead, and your should, be sure to be as efficient as you can in your own code.
If you have to run a command to get your data instead of reading it from /proc, that will be more
expensive.  If that command has to do a lot of work, it will be even more expensive.
<p>
It is recommended your take advantage of collectl's
<a href=http://collectl.sourceforge.net/Performance.html>built-in mechanism</a> for
measuring its own performance.  For example, measuring the performance of the <i>hello.ph</i> example,
which does almost nothing since it doesn't even look at /proc data, uses less than 1 second on an older
2GHz system.  Monitoring CPU performance data take about 3-1/2 seconds and memory counters take about
7 seconds, just to give a few examples of the more efficient types of data it collects.

<p><h3>Access to collectl internal functions, variable and constants</h3>
<p>
Collectl is relatively big, at least for a perl script, consisting of over 100 internal subroutines, 
most of which are simply for internal
housekeeping, but some of which are of a more general purpose.  It also keeps most of its statistical
data in single variables and one dimentional arrays.  Clearly hashes could make it more convenient
for passing data around but it was felt that the use of more complex data structures would generate
more overhead and so their use has been minimized.
<p>
While it is literally impossible to enumerate them all, there are a relatively small number of
functions, variables and constants that should be considered when writing your routines to 
insure a more seamless integration with collectl.  The following table is really only a means
to get started.  If you need more details of what a function actually does or how a variable is used,
read the code.

<center>
<table border=1 width=75%>
<tr><td width=20%><b>Function</b></td><td><b>Definition</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>cvt()</td><td>Convert a string to a fixed number of columns, appending 'K', 'M', etc
as appropriate.  Can also be instructed to divide counters by 1000 and sizes by 1024.</td></tr>
<tr><td>error()</td><td>Report error on terminal and if logging to a message file
write a type 'E' message.  Then exit</td></tr>
<tr><td>fix()</td><td>When a counter turns negative, it has wrapped.  This function will convert
to a positive number by adding back the size of a 32-bit word OR a user specified data width.</td></tr>
<tr><td>getexec()</td><td>Execute a command and record its output prepended with the supplied string</td</tr>
<tr><td>getproc()</td><td>Read data from /proc, prepending a string as with <i>getexec</i> except in
this case you can also instruct it to skip lines at the beginning or end.  See the function itself
for details</td></tr>
<tr><td>record()</td><td>Only needed if not using <i>getproc</i> which will call it for you, records
a single line of data</td></tr>
<tr><td width=20%><b>Variable</b></td><td><b>Definition</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>$datetime</td><td>The date/time stamp associated with the current set of data, in the user 
requested format, based on the use of -o.  See the constant <i>$miniFiller</i> which is a string of 
spaces of the same width.</td></tr>
<tr><td>$intSecs</td><td>The number of seconds in the current interval.  This is <i>not</i> an integer.</td></tr>
<tr><td width=20%><b>Constants</b></td><td><b>Definition</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>$miniFiller</td><td>A string of spaces, the same number of characters as in the 
<i>$datetime</i> variable</td></td>
<tr><td>$rate</td><td>A text string that is set to <i>/secs</i> and appended to most of
the verbose format headers, indicating rates are being displayed.  However, if the user specifies -on
with the collectl command to indicate non-normalized data, it is set to <i>/int</i> to indicate 
per-interval data is being reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>$SEP</td><td>This is the current plot format separator character, set to a space by default,
but can be changed with --sep so <i>never</i> hard code spaces into your plot format output.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>
<h3>The API</h3>
The API between collectl and user written code is actually a fixed number of callbacks.  In other
words, when you tell collectl to import a piece of code, it not only uses that name to identify
the code it also uses that name as a qualifier on the name of the functions it calls.
If you load a module called <i>mymodule</i>, collectl will then make calls to <i>mymoduleInit(),
mymoduleGetData()</i> and several others as enumerated in the table below.  You <i>must</i> include
all these function call backs in your code or prevent them from being called by restricting which
switches the user is allow to specify in the collectl command line.  For example if your module 
doesn't want to support plot data and you generate an error if the user specified -P (which can be
checked by examing <i>$plotFlag</i> in your init routine),  you can safely leave off the 
<i>PrintPlot</i> callback.
<p>

<center>
<table border=1 width=75%>
<tr><td width=20%><b>Function</b></td><td><b>Definition</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Analyze</td><td>Examine performance counters and generate values for current interval</td></tr>
<tr><td>GetData</td><td>Read performance data from /proc or any other mechanism of choice</td></tr>
<tr><td>Init</td><td>One time initializations are performed here</td></tr>
<tr><td>InitInterval<td>Initializations required for each processing cycle</td></tr>
<tr><td>PrintBrief</td><td>Build output strings for brief format</td></tr>
<tr><td>PrintExport</td><td>Build output strings for formatting by gexpr, lexpr and sexpr, which are 
3 standard collectl <i>--export</i> modules</td></tr>
<tr><td>PrintPlot</td><td>Build output string in plot format</td></tr>
<tr><td>PrintVerbose</td><td>Build output string in verbose format</td></tr>
<tr><td>UpdateHeader</td><td>Add custom line(s) to all file headers</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>
There are also several constants that must be passed back to collectl during intialization.
See <i>Init()</i> for more details.
<p>
<ul>
<li>A string consisting of 's', 'd', or 'sd', indicating whether or not this module supports 
<i>summary data, detail data</i> or <i>both</i>.
<li>A unique string for any data collected by this code and ultimately
passed to collectl in <i>record()</i>.  As a result, all data written to the raw file will be
prepended by this discriminator so that during actual collection and/or playback collectl will know
to call the analysis routine upon seeing this type of data.  Therefore this string must be unique
with respect to any other data collection qualification strings.  This string will also be used as an
extension for any detail plot files and so should be on the order of 3 or 4 characters long.</li> 
</ul>

<p><b>Analyze($type, \$data)</b>
<p>
This function is called for each line of recorded data that begins with the qualifier string that
has been set in <i>Init</i>.  Any lines that don't begin with that string will never be seen by 
this routine.  You should also be sure that string is unque enough that you aren't passed data 
you don't expect.
<ul>
<li><b>$type</b> is the first space-separated field from the recorded data.  It is completely under
your control to decide how to process that data.  In some cases there will only be a single line to
process and no further decisions will be required.  In other cases there
may be multiple lines and it may be necessary to include an additional descriminator when recording the
data so that the analysis routine can figure out what to do with it.  For example, try running with
-d4 and look at the data returned for -sf or -si.
<li><b>$data</b> is a reference to the string of everything that follows <i>$type</i> in the current
line of data being processed</li>
</ul>

<p><b>GetData()</b>
<p>
This function takes no arguments and is responsible for reading in the data to be recorded
and processed by collectl and as such you should strive to make it as efficient as possible.
If reading data from /proc, you can probably use the getproc()
function, using 0 as the first parameter for doing generic reads.  If you wish to execute
a command, you can call getexec() and pass it a 3 which is its generic argument for capturing
the entire contents of whatever command is being executed.
<p>
If you want to <i>do your own thing</i> you can basically do anything you want, but be sure
to call <i>record()</i> to actually write the data to the raw file and optionally
pass it to the analysis routine later on.
<p>
In any case, each record <i>must</i> use the same discriminator that <i>Analyze</i> is expecting 
so collectl can identify that data as coming from this module.  You may
also want to look at the data gathering loop inside of collectl to get a better feel for
how data collection works in general.
<p>
To make sure you're collecting data correctly, run collectl with -d4 as shown below for reading
socket data, which uses the string <i>sock</i> as its own discriminator.

<div class=terminal>
<pre>
collectl -ss -d4
>>> 1238001124.002 <<<
sock sockets: used 405
sock TCP: inuse 10 orphan 0 tw 0 alloc 12 mem 0
sock UDP: inuse 8 mem 0
sock RAW: inuse 0
sock FRAG: inuse 0 memory 0
</pre></div>

<p><b>Init(\$options, \$key)</b>
<p>
This function is called once by collectl, before any data collection begins.  If there are any
one-time intializations of variables to do, this is the place to do them.  For example, when processing
incrementing variables one often subtracts the previous value from the current one and this is the
ideal place to initialize their previous values to 0.  Naturally that will lead to erroneous results
for the first interval, which is why collectl never includes those stats in its output.  However, if
you don't initialize them to something you will get <i>uninitialized variable</i> warnings the first
time they're used.

<ul>
<li><b>$options</b> is a reference to the option string, if any, passed immediatedly
after the name following<i>--import</i> and specifies whether the user wants to see
<i>summary data, detail data</i> or <i>both</i>.  If none specified it must be set to the
default behavior desired for this module, typically 's'.</li>
<li><b>$key</b> is a reference to a string of usually 2-4 characters which will be
prepended to each data record and used in several places to associate data records with
this module</li>
</ul>

<p><b>InitInterval()</b>
<p>
During each data collection interval, collectl may need to reset some counters.  For example, when
processing disk data, collectl adds together all the disk stats for each interval which are then
reported as summary data.  At the beginning of each interval these counters must be reset to 0
and it's at that point in the processing that this routine is called.

<p><b>PrintBrief($type, \$line)</b>
<p>
The trick with brief mode is that that multiple types of data are displayed together on the same line.
That means each imported module must append its own unique data to the current line of output as it 
is being constructed without any carriage returns.  Further, since there are 2 header lines and 
<i>brief format</i> supports the ability to print running totals when one enters <i>return</i> during 
processing, there are a number of places one needs to have their code called from.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>$type</b> is an interger from 1 to 6 and is used to decide which subfunction to execute.
Think of it this a <i>case statement</i> control variable. 
<li><b>$line</b> is a reference to the current output line being constructed.  Simply append
whatever makes sense for that function, be it a header or a value.  In the case of the running
totals, since that is always printed on the terminal and never goes to a socket a simple
<i>print</i> is sufficient.
</ul>

<p><b>PrintExport($type, \$ref1, \$ref2, \$ref3, \$ref4)</b>
<p>
What about custom export modules and how this effects them?  
The good news is that at least for the standard 3, <i>sexpr, lexpr</i> and the newest
<i>gexpr</i> all support <i>--import</i>.  In other words they too have callbacks that you must repond
to if your code is being run at the same time as one of these.
<p>
Again, see <i>hello.ph</i> for an example, but suffice it to say you need to do something when
called, even if only a null function is supplied.
<p>
Since both <i>lexpr</i> and <i>sexpr</i> can write their output to the terminal, the easiest way
to test these is to just run collect and have it display on the terminal.  However, the output
of gexpr is binary and so the easiest way to test this code is to tell it not to open a socket
(though you must supply and address/port) and report the 3 data elements it is about to 
encode by running with a debug value of 9 noting this is <i>gexpr's</i> own internal debug
switch and not collectl's.

<div class=terminal>
<pre>
collectl --import hello --export gexpr,192.168.1.1:1234,d=9
Name: hwtotals.hw          Units: num/sec               Val: 140
Name: hwtotals.hw          Units: num/sec               Val: 230
Name: hwtotals.hw          Units: num/sec               Val: 320
</pre></div>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>$type</b> is a 'g', 'l' or 's' depending which of the 3 <i>expr</i> modules is exported and the
interpretation of the 4 references that follow are type dependent</li>
<li><b>type=g</b></li>
<ul>
<li><b>$ref1</b> is the data label</li>
<li><b>$ref2</b> is the units string</li>
<li><b>$ref3</b> is data value</li>
</ul>
<li><b>type=l</b></li>
<ul>
<li><b>$ref1</b> is the summary data label</li>
<li><b>$ref2</b> is the summary data value</li>
<li><b>$ref3</b> is the detail data label</li>
<li><b>$ref4</b> is the detail data value</li>
</ul>
<li><b>type=s</b></li>
<ul>
<li><b>$ref1</b> is the summary data line</li>
<li><b>$ref1</b> is the detail data line</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p><b>PrintPlot($type, \$line)</b>
<p>
This type of output is formatted for plotting, which while it can get quite complicated
based on whether you're writing to a terminal, multiple files or a socket, all that headache is
handled by collectl.  All you need to do is append your <i>summary</i> or <i>detail</i> data 
to the current line being constructed, similarly to the way brief data is handled.  Since it 
has to handle both headers as well as data, there are 4 <i>types</i> included in the call.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>$type</b> is used as a selector to specify whether header/data and if for summary/detail 
is to be constructed.</li>
<li><b>$line</b> is a reference to the current line being constructed.  Be sure to use $SEP as
a field separator so your code will correctly use collectl's <i>--sep</i> switch.
</ul>

<p><b>PrintVerbose($printHeader, $homeFlag, \$line)</b>
<p>
Like <i>PrintBrief</i>, this routine is in charge of printing verbose data but is much simpler
since it doesn't have to insert code into the middle of running strings. 
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>$printHeader</b> is actually a flag, which when set indicate it's time to print a header.
As you can see in hello.ph, there are 2 global string worth knowing about.  Both <i>$miniFiller</i>
and <i>$datetime</i> are normally set to null, but if the user specifies a time switch such as -oT,
the first will be set to the appropriate number of pad characters and the second set to the time
in the format chosed by -o.
<li><b>$homeFlag</b> is a localized copy of collectl's $homeFlag which when set indicates the
display is in <i>home</i> mode and section separating <i>returns</i> should be omitted from the
output to make it more dense.</li>
<li><b>$line</b> is a reference to the line about to be printed. Set it to the you wish to print,
rather than append to it.
</ul>

<p><b>UpdateHeader(\$line)</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>$line</b> is a reference to the string that contains the standard header that 
appears at the beginning of all collectl files.  This call is made immediately before 
writing out the final line of #s and so anything appended to this string will appear in
the header as its own unique line.  If you do not want to add anything to the header
simply make this an empty function.</li>
</ul>

<center><h3>Examples</h3></center>

<h3>Example 1 - Hello World</h3>
Included with collectl is the example file <i>hello.ph</i> which is a collectlized version of
hello world.  It simulates a <i>hw</i> subsystem consisting of 3 hw instances, which in turn
report a single counter.  Here is an example of its simulated /proc data, which is shown by
using -d4.  Also notice in this case the discriminator is <i>hw</i> but <i>-n</i> is also
included in the calls to <i>record()</i> to further identify individual devices:

<div class=terminal>
<pre>
collectl --imp hello -d4
>>> 1238167880.003 <<<
hw-0 HelloWorld 0
hw-1 HelloWorld 10
hw-2 HelloWorld 40
</pre></div>

You can use this example module with virtually any combinations of switches and any other collectl
subsystems as well as exporting the output over a socket, writing to a raw file or playing it back.
As you shoudl realize by now the combinations are far too extensive to list so below is only the
simplest one, showing this data combined with cpu stats in brief format with timestamps in msecs.
<div class=terminal>
<pre>
collectl --imp hello -sc -oTm
#             <--------CPU--------><-Hello->
#Time         cpu sys inter  ctxsw   Total
11:40:29.002    0   0  1027    126     140
11:40:30.002    0   0  1012    138     230
</pre></div>

For further information on using this capability see hello.ph which has been heavily annotated and
should make a good staring template for developing your own custom modules.
<p>
<h3>Example 2 - Misc</h3>
This custom module reports on several variable that are not collectled as part of collectl's core
metrics, partly because some of them don't exactly fit into collectl's main stats, but some users
still find useful.  There are also a few instructive techniques used in this simple module that 
are worth calling out:
<ul>
<li>use of its own routine grepProc() to find a specific entry in /proc and return either the  first
instance or the count of instances, nothing that using the real <i>grep</i> has far too much overhead</li>
<li>support for a different monitoring interval yet still displays, exports and logs the data every cycle</li>
<li>ability to pass additional parameters with values, in this case the interval</li>
<li>use of getExec() for running another process to get the number of logged in users, noting this is 
slower than getProc() and the command being used is slow enough that a different monitoring interval
is needed to avoid excess overhead.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following example shows one importing both hello.ph and misc.ph while displaying cpu data and
running all at the same interval:

<div class=terminal>
<pre>
[root@cag-dl585-02 collectl]# collectl -sc --import hello:misc
#<--------CPU--------><-Hello-><------CMU Extras----->
#cpu sys inter  ctxsw   Total   UTim  MHz MT Huge Log
   0   0  1034    149     140      94 2197  1    0   4
   0   0  1010    138     230      94 2197  1    0   4
</pre></div>

In this example we're just doing the 2 imports, setting the misc monitoring interval to 2
and exporting the data with lexpr.  As you can see, the hello data is reported every intereval
but the cmu data only every other one:

<div class=terminal>
<pre>
[root@cag-dl585-02 collectl]# collectl --import hello:misc,i=2 --export lexpr
