    Report from Martin Arlitt about missing Network interfaces so added those to
 formatit.ph

If you're real lazy, just run INSTALL and it will install collectl into the
same locations as the rpm.  It will install as /usr/bin/collectl and all the
other runtime components will be placed into /usr/share/collectl.  If you
really care where everything goes, read the script as it's pretty short.
There's also an UNINSTALL that will completely remove everything.

If you want to be more creative, you can either hack up the installation
script or use it as a guide to move things around to whereever you want them
keeping a couple of things in mind:
- collectl.conf is looked for first in /etc and then in its binary directory
- all ph files must be in the same directory as collectl itself OR /usr/share/collectl
