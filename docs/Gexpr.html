<center><h1>Exporting Data In Ganglia Format</h1></center>
<center><font size=6><i>experimental</i></font></center>
<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
With the release of Collectl Version 3.3.1, one can now send collectl data directly to
a <a href=http://ganglia.info/>ganglia</a> gmond in binary format using the custom export <i>gexpr.ph</i>.  This results
in several benefits for existing users of ganglia:
<p>
<ul>
<li>You can now get the benefit of collecting all the data collectl can generate
at a very low overheard.
<li>Since all collectl instances send this data at the same time, system noise on
clusters running fine-grained parallel jobs is reduced.
<li>You can still log all the data collectl collects locally and only send a subset
to gmond, making it possible to collect far more data than ganglia can handle without
overwhelming the gmetad. This is especially important on large clusters.
<li>And finally, you can monitor as frequently as you like and send data to ganglia at a
coarser frequency.
</ul>

<p>
The main reason for the <i>experimental</i> status is it is felt that over time the 
implementation details of this capability, such as the calling parameters, may change and 
anyone using it should be aware of that.  It is hoped that as usage increases the interface 
will become more stable and the exprimental status can be lifted.

<h3>Ganglia Configuration</h3>
The following figure shows one possible configuration of a large cluster running ganglia and
is only intended to be illustrative.  For complete documentaion on how to set up and configure
ganglia see the <a href=http://ganglia.wiki.sourceforge.net/>official wiki</a>.
<p>
This configuration assumes one has set up ganglia <i>gmond</i>s in a hierarchy, such that those at
the bottom of the tree collect system statistics and send them up to a higher level
aggregation gmond and ultimately percolate up to the <i>gmetad</i> which writes the data to
a <a href=http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/>round-robin database</a>.

<p>
To use collectl as a data source there are 2 alternatives.  In the diagram below at the left
you simply have collectl send data to a local gmond to suppliment whatever data it is
already collecting, noting there won't be any way to record any of gmond's data
locally.  The diagram at the right would replace all gmonds and have collectl do all the data
collection, optionall logging data locally, and sending data to an aggregration level gmond.
Whatever method you chose you must ensure the gmond(s) are listening on their udp receive
channel and enable the ganglia communications feature in collectl as described
in the following sections.  There are probably other hybrid
configurations which are beyond the scope of this document as well as this author.

One last component is configuring the rrd to use the metrics being supplied by collectl and
the details of that discussion are beyond the scope of this document as well.
<h3>Usage</h3>
Like any other <a href=Export.html>custom export</a> used by collectl, you tell collectl to
use gexpr with <i>--export gexpr</i> and in addition include the gmond <i>hostname:port</i>
followed by one or more of the standard <a href=Export.html> switches</a>.
<p>
The following example shows collectl gathering data on many system components but only sending
cpu, disk, memory and network data to a gmond on system <i>gmond</i> using port <i>8108</i>.
It also sends a set of data every 20 seconds while writing the data to a file in plot
format to a local file in /tmp every 5 seconds.
<p>
This module also supports sending its output to a multicast address, which is used if 
<i>hostname</i> in an address in the range of 225.0.0.0 through 239.255.255.255.  To use this 
feature you will have to first install 
<a href=http://search.cpan.org/~lds/IO-Socket-Multicast-1.05/Multicast.pm>
IO::Socket::Multicast</a> which in turn requires the module 
<a href=http://search.cpan.org/~lds/IO-Interface-1.05/Interface.pm>IO::Socket::Interface</a>
be installed as well.  Note that both these modules may be updated and so you should verify
you're actually installing the latest one.

<pre>
 collectl -scdfijmntx --export gexpr,gmond:8108,s=cdmn,i=20 -i5 -f /tmp -P
</pre></div>

<h3>Verification</h3>
There are 2 ways to make sure everything is working as expected, the first is to make sure you're
using the ganglia export module correctly and to do this you can use the <i>debugging</i> parameter.
Like collectl itself, which has its own debugging variable (see -d), the value of this
debugging variable should be interpretted as setting a bit mask, where each bit results in
different behavior.  Refer to the header of <i>gexpr</i> for the complete set, but
the following example uses 2 bits, one for printing the data being set over the socket
and the second with disables actually sending the data over the socket.
Note that in this case you are still required to supply a socket:port because they will be opened 
but also realize you can use just about anything you want since no data is actually sent over it.

Assuming you're now successfully calling gexpr and can see the output above, it's time to
make sure it is going to the expected gmond.  The easiet way to do this is to simply run
the gmond with debugging enabled at a level of at least 2 
and make sure it can see the data from collectl.  If
it can, you're done.  If not, you need to make sure gmond is correctly listening for udp
data and that the port it expects to see data on is in fact the one gexpr is sending to.
If all looks correct, it may be necessary to watch the network traffic with a tool like
udpdump or <a href=http://www.wireshark.org/>wireshark</a>.
<p>
This is an example of what you should expect to see, noting that in this case gmond
<i>is</i> still configured to collect its standard metrics, which can be disabled
in gmond.conf since you no longer need these.
