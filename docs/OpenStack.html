<center><h1>OpenStack Support</h1></center>
<p>
For the most part, the hardware configuration is static and so is collectl.  When you boot, it discovers
disks, networks and CPUs and that configuration doesn't change until you shutdown, reconfigure and
reboot. Clouds and virtual machines have turned this whole notion on its head, something that was bound
to happen anyway.  But it wasn't until several years ago when collectl started to be used in OpenStack
environments that this design restriction became significant and needed to be changed.  Since 2012
collectl has had the notion of dynamic Disks and Networks embedded in its core.  Dynamic CPUs were
added even earlier.  Collectl has been heavily tested in OpenStack clouds and is as rock solid as ever.
<p>
But what about cloud-specific subsystems?  Once collectl was able to deal with dynamic devices, additional
capabilities were added to deal with new cloud-specific subsystems as well.  While not everything in an
OpenStack cloud can be monitored one has to start somewhere and collectl has chosen to focus on the
following:
<p><b>Nova</b>
<p>In the case of Nova, almost all the data one needs to report on what a VM is doing is already being collected.
Specifically, a VM is using a CPU, a Disk and a Network so if one can tell which host resources they corresond to,
one can then associate their instance data with the VM and report something that looks like standard collectl
process data like this:

<div class=terminal>
<pre>
# PROCESS SUMMARY (counters are /sec)
# PID  THRD S   VSZ   RSS CP  SysT  UsrT Pct  N   AccumTim DskI DskO NetI NetO Instance

36841     1 S    4G  935M  7  0.24  0.32  56  1   12:31:27    0    0  445  445 009570bb
</pre>
</div>

The <i>magic</i> that makes this all work comes from 3 places.  First, the actual command that
starts the VM contains the CPU number, the MAC address of the
virtual network and even the instance ID.  The process data for the VM also contains runtime
information as well as memory usage, all of which are available if runs the command
<i>collectl -scnZ -i:1</i>, which is exactly what the export module named vmsum does under
the covers.
<p>
The second thing is one needs to figure out how to map the network MAC address to an actual network
name and for that a second plugin, this time an import module called vnet has been developed.  It
doesn't generate any output as do other import modules but rather loads the required data structures
that vmsum needs to find the network virtual device.
<p>
Finally, the disk stats come from the process data, but are only available when run as root, so the
ultimate command one needs to run to see the above output is the following, noting you will be warned
to use sudo if are not root.
<div class=terminal>
<pre>
sudo collectl --import vnet --export vmsum
</pre>
</div>

Be sure to try displaying VM output across a cluster with colmux.  You'll never look at your cluster
the same way again.

<p><b>Swift</b>
<p>Getting swift data is slightly more complicated because it doen't report statistics in am easy-to-use
form.  Rather its standard mechanism is to use <a href=http://statsd.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>statsd</a>,
which requires a statsd listener.  Further, since swift can only send to one listener, you can't have
multiple consumer's of the data, which is why <a href=https://github.com/markseger/swift-statstee>statstee</a>
was developed.  It is based on the philosphy of the unix <i>tee</i> command in that it can sit between the 
source and destination and record data locally, in this case to a file that looks like a /proc data structure.
<p>
For example, when you install/run statstee, it creates a file like the following which is updated with rolling
counters every tenth of a second (as long as something changes).  This means anyone can read that file as often
as they choose and simply report the differences between samples as rates, just like collectl already does
for all the other data it reports.

To make this data available to collectl, one simply imports the statsd plugin.  As it turns out, there is
a LOT of data that is provided by swift and in fact too much to display in a meaningful way.  Therefore
one should get in the habit of running statsd with the help option like this:

<div class=terminal>
<pre>
collectl --import statsd,h

usage: statsd, switches...
  d=mask  debug mask, see header for details
  h       print this help test
  f file  reads stats from specified file
  r       include return codes with proxy stats
  s       server: a, c, o and/or p
  t       data type to report, noting from the following
          that not all servers report all types

           t  name             servers
           a  auditor       acc  con  obj
           x  expirer                 obj
           p  reaper        acc   
           r  replicator    acc  con  obj
           s  server        acc  con  obj
           y  sync               con
           u  updater            con  obj

  p	   proxies require their own service type
	   a  account service
           c  container service
           o  object service

  v        show version and default settings
  xx       2 char specific types built from -s, -t and -p

  NOTE = setting s, t or p to * selects everything
</pre>
</div>
This can be a bit of a mouthful so perhaps an example will help.  Also try to get into the habit of NOT using
-s, -t or -p as those may eventually go away as I'm not sure they're really useful.  Looking at the matrix
above, think of the types of data you'd like to look at for which types of servers.  So say you want to
look at object server server data and container server replicator data at the same time.  These translate
to os and cr so you'd run the following, noting since this is standard collectl you can even include time
stamps:

<div class=terminal>
<pre>
collectl --import statsd,os,cr
waiting for 1 second sample...
#                       Container                                                Object                        
#<----------------------Replicator----------------------><-----------------------Server----------------------->
# Diff DCap Nochg Hasm Rsync RMerg Atmpt Fail Remov Succ   Put  Get Post Dele Head Repl Errs Quar Asyn PutTime 
     0    0    0     0    0     0     0     0    0     0     0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0   0.000
     0    0    0    17    0     0     0    60    0     0     0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0   0.000
</pre>
</div>

You can try various combinations of servers and services.  You can also use this plugin with colmux or even
generate output in plot format as there are now also a number of custom plots available for swift, many of
which are included when you select <i>All Summary Plots</i>.  See the help next to the <i>Plots by Name</i>
for more information.

<p><b>Neutron</b>

<p>There is currently one big issue with neutron and that is whenever you create a new VM, you get a new tap
and so overtime, the number of these devices continue to grow.  If you are generating device specific files,
you will see the number of networks collectl is tracking includes ALL networks that have ever existing since
collectl started.  This in turn means the columns in the <i>net</i> file will continue to grow uncontrolled.
If you have a set number of VMs that aren't changing, this may be ok but in most cases is won't be.  While
there is currently no good solution for how to deal with this, collectl does have a new options for
<i>--netopts</i>, specifically o, which tells collectl that whenever there is a change in the network
configuration, drop any unused networks from the current list.  This means you'll end up breaking the
column alignment in the detail file but at least it won't grow uncontrollably.  Since the names of the
networks ARE retained in the line items, you can still see what's happening but you won't be able to
get a consistent view with colplot.
<p>
A second situation is the shear volume of virtual network devices that one can have in a large cluster and
trying to collect data for them on the neutron nodes themselves can easily involve monitoring thousands of
devices which may start to consume more CPU cycles than you wish to use.  If this becomes the case, consider
using <i>--rawnetfilt</i> which tells collectl to not even collect data on the specified network(s).
