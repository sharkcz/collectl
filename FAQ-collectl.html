<h1>General Questions</h1>

<a name="gen1"></a>
<h2>What is the difference between collectl and sar?</h2>
At the highest level, both collectl and sar provide lightweight collection of 
device performance information.  However, when used in a diagnostic mode sar
falls short on a number of points, though admittedly some could be addressed
by wrapping it with scripts that reformat the data:
<ul>
  <li>sar plays back data by device/subsystem, sorted by time</li>
  <li>sar does not deal with sub-second time</li>
  <li>sar output cannot be directly fed into a plotting tool</li>
  <li>sar does not provide nfs, lustre or interconnect statistics
  <li>sar does not provide for the collection of slab data
  <li>sar's process monitoring is limited in that if cannot save
    process data in a file, cannot monitor threads, cannot select processes
    to monitor other than ALL or by pid (so cannot selectively discover new 
    processes) and in interactive mode is limited to 256 processes</li>
</ul>

<a name="gen2"></a>
<h2>Isn't a default monitoring frequency of 1 second going to kill my system?</h2>
Running collectl interactively at a 1 second interval has been shown to provide
mininal load.  However, for running collectl for long periods of time it is 
recommended to use a default monitoring period of 10 second and in fact is the 
default when collectl is run as a daemon and started using the 'service start
collectl command'.
<br>
A lot of effort has gone into making collectl very efficient in spite of the fact
that it's written in an interpretive language like perl, which by the way is known
for its efficiency.  collectl has been measured to use less than 0.01% of the cpu
on most systems at an interval of 10 seconds.  
To measure collectl's load on your own system you can use the command
"time collectl -i0 -c8640 -s??? -f." to see the load of collecting a day's worth 
of data for the specific subsystems included with the -s switch.

<a name="gen3"></a>
<h2>What is the best monitoring frequency?</h2>
There really isn't a 'best' per se.  In general collecting counter data every 10 seconds
and process/slab data every minute has been observed to produce a maximum amount of data
with a minimal load.  When this granularity isn't sufficient there have been uses for 
collecting data as 0.1 second intervals!  There have even been times when wanting to 
verify a short lived process really does start that doing process monitoring by name at 
an interval of 0.01 seconds has been found to be useful.

<a name="gen4"></a>
<h2>Why so many switches?</h2>
In general, most people will not need most switches and that's the main reason
for 'basic' vs 'extended' help.  However, it's also possible that there may be
an extended switch that provides some specific piece of functionality not there
with the basic ones and it is recommended that once you feel more comfortable
with the basic operations that you spend a little time looking at them too.

<a name="gen5"></a>
<h2>Why doesn't <i>--top</i> show as much data as the <i>top</i> command?</h2>
The simple answer is because this is <i>collectl</i>, not <i>top</i>.
Actually I thought of that and then decided with all the different switches
and options, the easiest thing to do is just run
a second instance of collectl in another window, 
showing whatever else you want to see in whatever
format you like.  You can even pick different monitoring intervals.

<a name="gen6"></a>
<h2>What does <i>collectl</i> stand for?</h2>
Collectl is based on  the very popular <i>collect</i> tool written by Rob Urban which
was distributed as with DEC's Tru64 Unix Operating System and therefore stands for
<i>collect for linux</i>.

<a name="gen7"></a>
<h2>How do you pronounce <i>collectl</i>?</h2>
It rhymes with pterodactyl.

<h1>Running collectl</h1>

<a name="run1"></a>
<h2>How do I get started?</h2>
The easiest way to get started is to just type 'collectl'.  It will report
summary statistics on cpu, disk and network once a second.  
If you want to change the subsystems being reported on use -s and to change
the interval use -i.  More verbose information can be displayed with --verbose.  See
the man pages for more detail.

<a name="run2"></a>
<h2>How do I make a plot?</h2>
Collectl supports saving data in plot format - space separated fields - through
the use of the -P switch.  The resultant output can then be easily plotted 
using gnuplot, excel or any other packages that understand this format.  You
can redirect collectl's output to a file OR it's much easier to just use the
-f switch to speficy a location to write the data.

<a name="run3"></a>
<h2>How do I drill down to get a closer look at what's going on?</h2>
The first order of business is to familiarize yourself with the types of data 
collectl is capable of collecting.  This is best done by looking at the data
produced by all the different settings for -s, both lower and upper case as 
there is some detail data that is not visible at the summary level.  
Take a look at -sd and -sD.  If you still
don't see something it might actually be written in -P format.  See -sT for an
example.
<br>
Next, run collectl and instruct it to log everything (or at least as much as you 
think you'll need) to a file.  When you believe you've collected enough data - and
this could span multiple days - identify times of interest or just plot everything
(see the -P switch).
Visually inspecting the plotted data can often show times of unusually heavy resource
loads.  Often times there is a strong time delineation between good and bad.
<br>
It you want to see the actual numbers in the data as opposed to plots,
play back the data using the -b switch to 
select a begin time, usually a few samples prior to the time when things started to
go bad.  To reduce the amount of output you can also use -e to set the end time for
the collection.  You can also start selecting specific subsystems to look at as well
as individual devices.  For example, if you've discovered that at 11:03 there was 
an unusal network load, try 'collectl -p filename -b 11:02 -e 11:05 -sN' to see
the activity at each NIC.
<br>
And don't forget process and/or slab activity if either has been collected.  You can
also play back this data at specific time intervals too.

<a name="run4"></a>
<h2>I want to look at detail data but forgot to specify it when I collected the 
data.  Now what?</h2>
Good news!  With the exception of CPU data, collectl always collects
detail data whether you ask for it or not - that's how it generates the 
summaries.  When you extract data into plot format, by default it extracts the
data based on the switches you used when you collected it.  So, if you 
specified -sd you'll only see summary data when you extract it.  BUT if you
include -s+D during the generation of plotting data you WILL generate disk
details as well.

<a name="run5"></a>
<h2>How do I configure collectl to run all the time as a service?</h2>
Use the chkconfig to change collectl's setting to 'on'.  On boot, collectl will
be automatically started.  To start collectl immediately, type 
'service collectl start'.

<a name="run6"></a>
<h2>How do I change the monitoring parameters for the 'service'?</h2>
Edit /etc/collectl.conf and add any switches you like to the 'DaemonCommands'
line.  To verify these are indeed compatible (some switches aren't), cut/paste
that line into a collectl run command to make sure they work before trying to
start the service.

<a name="run7"></a>
<h2>What are the differences between --rawtoo and --sexpr</h2>
--rawtoo will cause data to be written to the <i>raw</i> file in addition
to a plottable one, which can be overkill in many situations.  --sexpr
will cause the contents of most counters to be written to the same file
as an <i>s-expression</i> after each monitoring cycle and is intended to 
be consumed by a program and not a human.  
For more details see <i>man collectl-logging</i>

<a name="run8">
</a><h2>How can I pass collectl data to other applications like CMU?</h2>
In environments such as CMU that support the integration of external data 
sources all you need to do is run collectl with <i>--sexpr</i> as described
above.  You can now pass the counters of interest to CMU WITH with the 
collectl <i>readS</i>  utility, which is
installed as part of the <i>collectl-utils</i> rpm.  This utility will
read a specific counter from an s-expression and print it to stdout, 
which is the way CMU integrates external data.
<p>
The arguments to readS take the following form:
<p><tt>dir category variable [instance [divisor]]</tt>
<ul>
  <li>dir - directory in which the s-expression S exists, often
      /var/log/collectl
  <li>category - category of data element, such asc <i>cputotals</i> or <i>diskinfo</i>
  <li>variable - the name of a summary item such as <i>nice</i> for cpu data 
      or the name of the detail category such as <i>diskinfo</i>.
  <li>instance - for detail data this is the instance name
  <li>divisor - divide the results by this number, noting for summary data 
      <i>instance</i> needs to be a null string
</ul>

Detailed customization instructions for use of data returned by <i>readS</i> 
within CMU or other applications is beyond the scope of this FAQ.

<h1>Lustre Specific</h1>

<a name="lus1"></a>
<h2>Tell me again about the differences between -sL and -sLL</h2>
<p>
The easiest way to think about this is that -sL provides details and
-sLL provides more details.  Lustre data is oriented around filesystems
and filesystems are built on top of one or more OSTs.  Therefore, at
the client level -sL provides details at the filesystem level and -sLL 
provides data at the OST level.  In the case of an OSS, it's already
at the OST level and so there's really no lower level of detail.  As a
matter of convenience, -sLL does the same as -sL on an OSS.  An MDS only
generates detail level data at the disk block level and -sL and -sLL 
on it both provide the same details.

<a name="lus2"></a>
<h2>I just collected client data with -OBMR so how to I create details?</h2>
<p>
The thing to remember is that you can either generate filesystem details
or ost details but not both.  Since M&R apply to filesystems and B to OSTs,
you would playback the raw data file with <i>-sL -OMR</i> to generate M&R
date or with <i>-sLL -OB</i> to generate rpc-buffer details at the OST
level.

<a name="lus3"></a>
<h2>I tried to play back a lustre client raw file with -sL and it told
   me I need -sLL for -OB</h2>
<p>
By design, <i>collectl</i> tries to play back data using the same switches
that were used when you collected it.  This error message would be 
generated if you collected data using -OBM and tried to play it back by
only specifying -sL, in which case it would take -OBM as the default,
and -oB is incompatible with -sL. 

<a name="lus4"></a>
<h2>I tried to playback the same file using -sLL and it told me -OM
   does not apply to -sLL</h2>
<p>
As in the previous case, by only specifying -sLL it would again take -OBM
as the default and this time -OM is incompatible with -sLL.

<a name="lus5"></a>
<h2>So how do I play it back the file described in the last 2 questions?</h2>
<p>
The trick here is to <i>always</i> specify -O and include those subsystem options
that are compatible with your -s switch.

<h1>Operational Problems</h1>

<a name="ops1"></a>
<h2>Why won't collectl run as a service?</h2>
As configured, collectl will write its date/time named log files to 
/var/log/collectl, rolling them every day just after midnight and retaining 
one week's worth.  In addition it also maintains a 'message log' file named for
the host, year and month, eg hostname-200508.log - the creation of the message log is
driven off the -m switch in DaemonCommands.  Check this log for any messages
that should explain what is going on.

<a name="ops2"></a>
<h2>Why is my 'raw' file so big?</h2>
By default, collectl will collect a lot of data - as much as 10 or more MB/day!
If the perl-Compress library is installed, these logs will automatically be 
compressed and are typically less than 2MB/day.
<br>
The output file size is also effected by the number of devices being monitored.
In geneneral, even on large systems the number network interfaces is small and
shouldn't matter, but if the number of disks gets very high, say in the dozens
or more, this can begin to have an effect on the file size.  The other big
variable is the number of processes when collecting process data.  As this 
number grows to the many hundreds (or more), you will see the size of the data
file grow.
<br>
Finally the other parameter that effects size is the monitoring interval.  The
aforementioned sizes are based on the defaults which are process/slab 
monitoring once every 60 seconds and device monitoring once every 10 seconds.
Did you override these and make them too small?

<a name="ops3"></a>
<h2>Playing back multiple files to terminal doesn't show file names</h2>
By design, collectl is expected to be used in multiple ways and a lot of 
flexibility in the output format has been provided.  The most common 
way of using playback mode is to play back a single file and therefore the name
of the file is not displayed.  The -m switch will provide the file names as
they are processed.

<a name="ops4"></a>
<h2>Why don't the averages/totals produced in <i>brief</i> mode look correct?</h2>
There may be two reasons for this, the most obvious being that by default the 
intermediate numbers are normalized into a /sec rate and the averages/totals
are based on the raw numbers.  If the monitoring interval is 1 sec or you use
-on to supress normalization, the results will be very close.
<br>
The other point to consider is that numbers are often stored at a higher 
resolution than displayed and so there is less round-off error with the averages
and totals.

<a name="ops5"></a>
<h2>I'm getting errors "<i>Ignoring '!' modifier for short option</i>"</h2>
As of Version 2, collectl expects at least perl version 5.8 to be installed.  If
you do not have a newer version of perl and cannot install a newer one, you can 
get around this problem by installing a newer version of the module <i>perl-Appconfig</i>.
Unfortunately, newer versions of perl-Appconfig only operate with perl 5.8 or 
greater so you will have to install it on some other system running perl 5.8 first.  
Then you need to manually replace the three modules <i>Getopt.pm, Long.pm</i> and 
<i>Std.pm</i> on your perl 5.6 system, which can be found under /usr/lib/perl5/.  
It is also recommended you rename rather than overwrite the originals.

<a name="ops6"></a>
<h2>What does <i>New slab created after logging started</i> mean?</h2>
When collectl first starts, it builds a list of all the existing slabs.
As the message states, collectl has discovered a new slab and adds it to
its list.  This is relatively rare but can also indicate collection was
started too soon, possibly before system processes or applications
have allocated system data structures.  It is really just an informational
message and can safely be ignored.

<a name="ops7"></a>
<h2>Why does collectl say <i>waiting for 60 second sample...</i> but doesn't?</h2>
This is very rare as it will only happen when collecting a small number of process
or slab data samples, but it is also worth understanding what is happening
because it gets into the internal mechanics of data collection.  In addition to the
normal counter collectl uses to collect most data, it also maintains a second
one for coarser samples such as process and slab data.  When reporting how long
collectl is going to wait for a sample, it uses a number based on the type of
data being collected.  In almost all cases this is the value of the fine-grained
counter, but if only collecting process or slab data, it reports the second
counter whose default is 60 seconds.
<p>
Collection of counters, such as disk traffic or cpu load, always requires 2
samples since it's their different that represent the actual value.  Other
data such as memory in use or process data only require a single sample 
<i>but</i> in order to synchronize all the values being reported, collectl
always uses its first sampling interval to collectl a base sample and doesn't
actually report anything until the second sample is taken which is why it
reports the <i>waiting...</i> message even if it isn't being asked to report
any counters.
<p>
Finally, the -c switch which specifies the number of samples to collect
applies to the finer-grained counter.  This means if you try to collect a number
of samples that will cause the -c switch limit to be reached because any data
is actually collected, you will see collectl exit without reporting anything!
The best example of this would be the command <i>collectl -sZ -c1</i>.
Since the default interactive sample counters are 1 and 60 seconds respectively
<i>and</i> collectl has to actually take 2 samples, collectl will only run long
enough for one tick of the fine-grained counter or 1 second and immediately
exit with no output.  Therefore to 
collect 1 process sample you will actually need to use -c60 but will also have
to wait 60 seconds to see anything.  
Alternatively you could set the fine-grained sample counter to the same as
the process sample counter
and so the command <i>collectl -i60:60 -sZ -c1</i> would also report 1 sample
after waiting for 60 seconds.  If you want to collect a sample after just 1
second, you should use <i>collectl -i:1 -sZ -c1</i>.

<a name="ops8"></a>
<h2>Why am I not seeing exceptions only with -ox?</h2>
Exception processing requires --verbose.  Did you forget to include it?

<a name="ops9"></a>
<h2>I'm seeing a bogus data point!</h2>
This message means collectl has read a corrupted network statistics record
and is ignoring it.  It also turns out this has been attributed to some
bnx2 chips and a workaround has been generated for newer drivers.  If you
want a little more information your can read about it
<a href=http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/davem/net-2.6.git;a=commit;h=02537b0676930b1bd9aff2139e0e645c79986931>
here.</a>
<p>
The way collectl determines a record is bogus is to look at the transmit and receive 
rates for each interface and compare them to the speed of that interface
(from ethtool <i>and</i> if running as <i>root</i> OR ELSE it uses
the value of <i>DefNetSpeed</i> which can be overridden in collectl.conf).
It either exceeds twice the inteface rate, the record is considered bogus
and ignored.  This will cause collectl to report the previous rate
for this interval.  While not foolproof, it is hoped this will reduce the
frequency of this type of data.
