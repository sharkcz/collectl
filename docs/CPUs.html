<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
As of Version 3.4.2 of collectl, collectl can now detect
dynamic changes to a CPU's state.  In other words, going offline or coming back online.
When one or more CPUs is indeed found to be off line, collectl will include a message in
an output header to indicate this.  Furthermore, when display CPU numbers in headers, those
names will have their number changed to Xs to indicate this has occurred, such as in the 
following:

<div class=terminal>
<pre>
[root@node02 mjs]# ./collectl.pl -scj
waiting for 1 second sample...
# *** One or more CPUs disabled ***
#<--------CPU--------><-----------------Int------------------>
#cpu sys inter  ctxsw Cpu0 Cpu1 Cpu2 CpuX Cpu4 Cpu5 Cpu6 Cpu7
   0   0  1051     49 1000   17    0    0    4    0    0   29
</pre>
</div class=terminal>

As the state changes, the headers will change accordingly.  If there is a state change between 
headers this won't be seen until the next headers are displayed.  If displaying detail data,
one CAN tell the stat has changed.  In the case of looking at only CPU data, ALL percentages for
a CPU that is offline will display as zeros.  If looking at interrupts, the CPU number will be 
changed to an X in the header (see <i>Restrictions</i> below).
<p>
When logging to a file, if any CPUs are found to be offline when collectl starts, that number
will be written to the file header in the field <i>CPUsDis</i>.  A new flag <i>D</i> will also
be added to the <i>Flags</i> field.  However, one will still see the same effects of a CPU
state change in the output during playback.
<p>
<b>Restrictions</b>
<br>If a CPU goes offline <i>after</i> collectl has started and one is logging to disk, it will not
be noted in the file header.
<p>
When monitoring process data, this header will indicate if a CPU was found to be offline at the
time collectl started as well as during processing.  However, if the state changes and you're not
explicitly displaying CPU data, there will be no indication of dynamic CPU state changes reported.
<p>
If you are only monitoring interrupt data and there is a state change things will get very messy.
As users typically monitor Interrupts and CPU data at the same time it is not felt to be worth 
the extra effort or processng overhead to try and accommodate this rare case.
