If you're real lazy, just run INSTALL and it will install collectl into the
same locations as the rpm.  It will be rooted at /opt/hp/collectl and several
symlinks will be created back to the executables and man pages.  There's also
an UNINSTALL that will completely remove everything.

If you're only just lazy and want to install in a difference location, I'm 
lazy too and so hardcoded the installation directory into INSTALL and UNINSTALL
but it will only take a 1 line change to point them whereever your want.  Just
be sure to change it in both places.

If you want to be more creative, you can either hack up the installation
script or use it as a guide to move things around to where ever you want them
keeping a couple of things in mind:
- collectl.conf is looked for first in /etc and then in its binary directory
- all ph files must be in the same directory as collectl itself
