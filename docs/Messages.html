<p>
When something that may be of interest occurs, collectl calls an internal message reporting
routine and assigns that message a status of <i>Informational, Warning, Error</i> or <i>Fatal</i>.
The way collectl deals with these messages is controlled by several factors:
<p>
<ul>
<li>If collectl is started as a daemon and the -m switch is specified, all messages will be
written the the message log in the collectl logging directory, the default being /var/log/collectl.
If this switch is not specified no messages are ever recorded and so it is recommended that
this switch, which is already in the collectl startup script, not be removed.</li>
<li>When run interactively, all messages except those of type Informational are displayed on the
terminal.</li>
<li>When run interactively and -m is specified, ALL messages are displayed on the terminal.
When collectl is not providing the desired results and it is not obvious why, adding this
switch can be helpful.</li>
</ul>
If a message of type Fatal is encountered, collectl will terminate.  In all other cases it continues
executing, often skipping what it was trying to do when the error occurred.
