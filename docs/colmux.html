<h3>Introduction</h3>
Have you ever seen an nfs server getting beaten up but didn't know which of the
many hundreds of clients were doing the beating?  Or have you wondered if an
application was leaking memory when it ran but there was no easy way to observe
all the memory on all the nodes at the same time?  Or how about whether or not
a few disks in a large farm had slow access times and so were slowing down <i>all</i>
the disks?  It has always been easy to observe all of these types of behaviors with collectl
one node at a time, or even plot the data after the fact with colplot.  But observing
cluster-wide activity in real-time has never been that easy, until now.
<p>
As its name implies, colmux is a <i>collectl multiplexor</i>, which allows 
one to collect data from multiple systems and treat it as a single data 
stream, essentially extending collectl's functionality to a set of hosts
rather than a single one.  Colmux has been tested on clusters of over 1000 
nodes but one should also take note that this will put a heavier load on 
the system on which colmux is running.
<p>
Colmux runs in 2 distinct modes: <i>Real-Time</i> and <i>Playback</i>.
In real-time mode, colmux actually communicates with instances of
collectl running on remote systems which in turn are collecting real-time
performance metrics. In playback mode colmux also communicates with a 
remote copy of collectl but in this case collectl is playing back a data 
file collected some time in the past.
<p>
Colmux can also provide its output in 2 distinct formats: 
<i>single-line</i> and <I>multi-line</i>.  In single-line format colmux
reports the multiplexed data from all systems on a single line by allowing
the user to choose a small number of variables to display, based on both
the display width and the number of systems.  While it is possibly to handle
more than a couple of dozen systems, (see the example at the bottom of this
page), one rarely does so because of the screen width.
However it is also possible to redirect the output to a file
for <i>off-line</i> viewing, via a text editor or a spreadsheet.  
<p>
Colmux has been extensively tested on versions of collectl from V3.3.6 forward
and there have been some additional enhancements made to V3.5.0, which is the
recommended minimal version.  You should first make sure all the systems of interest
have the latest versions of collectl installed or at least those at V3.3.6 or newer.

<p>
Colmux also provides the ability for dynamic interaction with the keyboard arrow
keys if the optional perl module <i>Term::ReadKey</i> has been installed.  To see if
this is the case and that colmux can find it run with -v and you should see the
following:
<div class=terminal-wide14><pre>
colmux -v
colmux: 3.0 (Term::ReadKey: V2.30)
</pre></div>
<p>

<tr align=center><td><b><i>Restriction</i></b></tr></td>
<tr><td>Colmux <i>requires</i> passwordless ssh between it and all hosts it is monitoring</td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>
<h3>Using colmux</h3>
Although colmux does not have any required switches, <i>-command</i> is one of the
two most important as you use it to tell collectl what switches to use when running.
Colmux will then take care of multiplexing the command out to multiple instances 
of collectl either running them in real-time or playback mode.  The other key switch,
also not required but typically used, is <i>-address</i> because it identifies the 
remote system(s) on which to run colmux.  The default addess is that of the host colmux
is running on.
<p>
The inclusion of a playback filename 
in the collectl command instructs colmux to run in playback mode and the use of 
colmux's <i>-cols</i> switch tells it to produce output in <i>single-line</i> format.  
By using various combinations of these switches you can get colmux to run in any 4 
distinct modes as shown in the following table:
<p>
<center>
<table cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 border=1>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><b>Real-Time</b></td><td><b>Playback</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Single-line</b></td><td>-cols</td><td>-command "-p filename" -cols</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Multi-line</b></td><td><i>default</i></td><td>-command "-p filename"</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>
Let's discuss these 4 options separately to give a better feel for what they actually
mean and when you might use them. Note that the 2 operational modes have nothing to do
with the way the data is displayed and the 2 formats have nothing to do with the way
the data is collected - in other words a complete separation between form and function.
<p>
<b>Real-Time Mode</b>
<br>
If you've ever run collectl before, and you probably have if you're looking at these
utilities, you already know the real-time nature of the tool.  The difference here is that
with colmux you're actually able to look at multiple systems at the same time.
By default, colmux runs in real-time mode unless you explicitly instruct it to
run in playback mode by including -p in the collectl command.
<p>
<b>Playback Mode</b>
<br>
The way you tell colmux to run in this mode is to simply point the collectl command at
a file with the -p switch as you would normally do when you want to play back a file.
The main restriction is that the file needs to exist on all the systems you've pointed
colmux to and therefore wild cards are required for portion of the filename and that 
includes the hostname and are often used for the timestamp portion as well.
<p>
Typically one simply uses a collectl 
playback filename in a format something like <i>/var/log/collectl/*20101225*</i>,
wildcarding all but the date of interest.  If you want, you can put all the collectl 
files in one directory on the same system colmux is running on, but this method is 
restricted to <i>only</i> running on the local system. 
<p>
During playback by colmux, only the data falling in the same
time interval will be reported and so the header that reports how many nodes have had
their data included becomes more meaningful in case there is missing data. 
<p>
<b>Multi-Line Format</b>
<br>
Once you've decided which systems you want to monitor and what collectl command
you want to execute, you need to decide whether you're interested in single- or
multi-line output.  Most users will probably be interested in the multi-line
format, at least at first.  Think of the linux top command but not being limited
to just processes.
<p>
Multi-line format reports <i>all data</i> provided by collectl in its original
format. Further, it sorts it by a column of the user's choice (the default
is column 1) and presents
as much data as will fit on the screen.  The result is a <i>top-like utilility</i>
capable of reporting the top consumers of virtually any resource on the cluster
be it the more traditional process statistics or something more exotic such
as memory or network consumption.  
<p>
Since this IS native collectl data it can
be virtually anything, including that provided by any custom <i>import</i>
modules you may have written.   You will also see the identical information in playback mode,
though this is presented as scrolling text (there
is also a <i>-home</i> switch to display the data in <i>top</i> format if you wish, 
but unless you include <i>-delay</i> it may scroll by too fast to be of use).
<p>
The main consideration with multi-line format is that colmux can only deal with
collectl commands that themselves only produce single line output OR multiple lines
that are all the same format, noting that data provided by a custom import are
considered to be a single device themselves.  These include:
<ul>
<li>output in brief mode</li>
<li>verbose output for a single subsystem</li>
<li>detail output for a single device</li>
<li>process or slab data</li>
<li>environmental data in single line format</li>
</ul>
<p>
While the column number to sort on should also be a consideration, and you can 
manually select it at startup with <i>-column</i>, you can easily change the sort
column once colmux is running by either using the arrow keys (if Term::ReadKey 
has been installed) or simply typing the desired column number followed by the 
<i>enter</i> key.  This works in both real-time and playback mode.
<p>
Below is an example of examing the network traffic on 5 nodes and sorting
it by column 2.  As you can also see, all 5 nodes have reported data for
the interval being displayed and colmux highlights the selected column, though
not as the bolded text shown in the examples that follow but rather in reverse video:

<div class=terminal-wide14><pre>
colmux -addr 'xx1n[1-5]' -command "-sn" -column 2

# Wed Dec 29 05:42:21 2010  Connected: 5 of 5
#         <----------Network---------->
#Host       KBIn  <font face=arial black><b>PktIn</b></font>  KBOut  PktOut
xx1n1          9     82     42     326
xx1n2          9     77     41     320
xx1n5          8     75     41     318
xx1n4          8     74     41     317
xx1n3          8     71     40     314
</pre></div>
<p>
<b>Single-Line Format</b>
<br>
Unlike multi-line format which only displays output for the top systems which can change
from interval to interval, in single-line format you <i>always</i> see the selected data
for <i>all</i> systems and it is <i>never</i> sorted but rather reported in a fixed
format.  Therefore you need to tell colmux which data fields you're interested in when
you first start it up.  To determine the correct column numbers you can either run the
desired collectl command manually and start counting columns, noting the first column is
always 1, <i>or</i> you can use colmux's <i>-test</i> switch, which you can also use in multi-line format.
This switch will display the header line of collectl's output including the hostname as column 0,
with  the column(s) you have selected highlighted, as well as a list of all the columns
and their numbers for quick reference.
<div class=terminal-wide14><pre>
colmux -command "-sc" -test -cols 3,4
>>> Headers <<<
#          <--------CPU-------->
#Host      cpu sys <font face=arial black><b>inter  ctxsw</b></font>

>>> Column Numbering <<<
 0 #Host  1 cpu    2 sys    3 inter  4 ctxsw
</pre></div>
<p>
Once you have decided on the column numbers, there are a couple of other optional
switches you may choose to use, including timestamps, data type totals and for
very wide displays you can even request the columns be narrower and to divide each value
by 1000 or 1024. To preface each line with a timestamp, you actually include the appropriate time format
switch with the collectl command itself, rather than using a distinct colmux switch. <i>caution: when including timestamps the column numbering is shifted
appropriately and so you may want to use -test to be sure you're specifying 
the correct columns.</i>
<p>
Here is an example of the same command to look at network data, except in this case
colmux has been instructed report data for only columns 3 and 4, to print time
stamps at the beginning of each line and to report totals at the far right.  
As colmux first starts you can see the data being reported as all -1s since those 
systems have not yet sent any data back:
<p>
<div class=terminal-wide14><pre>
colmux -addr 'xx1n[1-5]' -command "-sn -oT" -cols 2,4 -coltot

#Time    xx1n1  xx1n2  xx1n3  xx1n4  xx1n5  |  xx1n1  xx1n2  xx1n3  xx1n4  xx1n5  |     KBIn    KBOut
05:29:48    -1     -1     -1     -1     -1  |     -1     -1     -1     -1     -1  |        0        0
05:29:49     2      2      2      2      2  |      0      0      0      0      0  |       10        0
05:29:50     2      2      2      2      2  |      0      0      0      0      0  |       10        0
05:29:51     9     10      4      8      9  |     41     42      3     41     42  |       40      169
05:29:52     2      2      9      2      2  |      0      0     40      0      0  |       17       40
05:29:53     2      2      2      2      2  |      0      0      0      0      0  |       10        0
05:29:54     2      2      2      2      2  |      0      0      0      0      0  |       10        0
</pre></div>
<p>
The following screenshot is an example of looking 
at Infiniband traffic between 16 clients writing to 4 lustre servers and
even though the font is small, you can still make out the patterns of
the column widths changing.
The left half of the display shows <i>network received KB</i>
and the right half <i>network transmitted KB</i>.  The first 4 columns in each section are
the lustre servers and the next 16 columns the clients.  As expected during a client 
write test, the lustre servers show high receive traffic and the clients show high
transmit traffic.  Look how easy it is to see drops in the client transmission rates 
even if you can't easily read the numbers. Also notice that the second client isn't 
doing any transmitting at all and since it's not displaynig -1 we know collectl <i>is</i>
running correctly.

Here's an even more dense example showing CPU load on a large cluster which is so 
wide it takes 3 monitors to display it all.  Even though you can't read the output you
can still see different patterns as some systems start/stop and others sit idle.
