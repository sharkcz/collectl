<center><h1>Exporting Data to Graphite</h1></center>
<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
With the release of Collectl Version 3.6.1, you can now send collectl data directly to <a href=http://graphite.wikidot.com>
graphite </a>.  For existing collectl users this now provides you with yet another way to store/plot collectl data, whether on
a single system or hundreds.  For graphite users who are not yet collectl users, you now have access to literally hundreds
of performance metrics:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Since all collectl instances send this data at the same time, system noise on
clusters running fine-grained parallel jobs is reduced.</li>
<li>You can still log all the data collectl collects locally and only send a subset
to graphite, reducing the load on both graphite and your network.</li>
<li>You can monitor as infrequently as you like and send data to graphite at a
coarser frequency of either of the average, minimum or maximum values over that interval.</li>
<li>All this at collectl's low monitoring overhead</li>
</ul>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
You use this export like any other, the only required option being the address to send the data to as in
the following example:

<div class=terminal>
<pre>
collectl --export graphite,192.168.1.113
</pre></div>

For help with what other valid switches are, you can actually get the graphite module itself to tell
you like this:

<div class=terminal>
<pre>
collectl --export graphite,h

usage: --export=graphite,host[:port][,options]
  where each option is separated by a comma, noting some take args themselves
    b=string    preface each variable name with string
    co          only reports changes since last reported value
    d=mask      debugging options, see beginning of graphite.ph for details
    f           use fqdn instead of simple hostname for statistics naming
    h           print this help and exit
    i=seconds   reporting interval, must be multiple of collect's -i
    p=text      insert this text right after hostname, including '.' if you want one
    s=subsys    only report subsystems, must be a subset of collectl's -s
    ttl=num     if data hasn't changed for this many intervals, report it
                only used with 'co', def=5
    min         report minimal value since last report
    max         report maximum value since last report
    avg         report average of values since last report


</pre></div>

However you should also note that since by design this export does not provide any terminal output, there
are only 2 real ways to make sure it is doing what you expect, the first being to inspect graphite's
whisper storage area for your particular host name and make sure the data you're collecting is in fact
showing up there:

<div class=terminal>
<pre>
ls /opt/graphite/storage/whisper/poker
cpuload  cputotals  ctxint  disktotals  nettotals
</pre></div>

or to simply run with the debug mask set to 1, which tells the graphite module to echo all the data it is
sending to graphite, noting in this case even though collectl is collecting cpu, disk and network data we're
not sending cpu data to graphite.  This is something you might do if logging more data to disk than you are
sending to graphite, which in this case we are:

<div class=terminal>
<pre>
collectl --export graphite,192.168.1.113,d=1,s=dn -rawtoo -f /var/log/collectl
poker.disktotals.reads 0 1325609789
poker.disktotals.readkbs 0 1325609789
poker.disktotals.writes 0 1325609789
poker.disktotals.writekbs 0 1325609789
poker.nettotals.kbin 0 1325609789
poker.nettotals.pktin 1 1325609789
poker.nettotals.kbout 0 1325609789
poker.nettotals.pktout 0 1325609789
</pre></div>

<b><i>tip</i></b> - if you add 8 to the debug flag, eg <i>d=9</i>, this tells the graphite module not to 
actually establish the connection with graphite's carbon listener but to only echo the data that would 
have been sent.
<p>
Once you're happy with the switch settings, be sure to update the <i>DaemonCommands</i> in /etc/collectl.conf
and restart the collectl daemon to make them take effect.
<p>
<h3>Communications</h3>
<p>
Collectl will attempt to establish a TCP connection to the specified address/port, noting the default port is 2003.
If that connection cannot be established, collectl will report an error but <i>not</i> exit!  This is because
graphite itself may be down and need to be restarted.

<div class=terminal>
<pre>
collectl --export graphite,192.168.1.113,d=1,s=dn
Could not create socket to 192.168.1.113:2003.  Reason: Connection refused
</pre></div>

By design when collectl assumes the graphite address is correct and will try to reconnect every monitoring
interval.  Further, to avoid generating too many errors, it will silently continue to retry and only report
the connection failure every 100 times, a constant you can modify in the graphite.ph header if you really
care.  Once graphite comes back online collectl will again start sending data to it.
